/**
 * Phantom reference objects, which are enqueued after the collector
 * determines that their referents may otherwise be reclaimed.  Phantom
 * references are most often used for scheduling pre-mortem cleanup actions in
 * a more flexible way than is possible with the Java finalization mechanism.
 *
 * <p> If the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time that the
 * referent of a phantom reference is <a
 * href="package-summary.html#reachability">phantom reachable</a>, then at that
 * time or at some later time it will enqueue the reference.
 *
 * <p> In order to ensure that a reclaimable object remains so, the referent of
 * a phantom reference may not be retrieved: The <code>get</code> method of a
 * phantom reference always returns <code>null</code>.
 *
 * <p> Unlike soft and weak references, phantom references are not
 * automatically cleared by the garbage collector as they are enqueued.  An
 * object that is reachable via phantom references will remain so until all
 * such references are cleared or themselves become unreachable.

// 虚引用，也称为幽灵引用或者幻象引用，它是最弱的一种引用关系。它是一种特殊的引用，不能通过虚引用获
// 取到其关联的对象。但当GC时，如果其引用的对象被回收，程序是可以感知的。即，被回收的对象会被加入到
// 相关引用队列中。因此，虚引用必须和引用队列|ReferenceQueue|联合使用
// 注：一个对象设置虚引用关联的唯一目的，就是能在这个对象被收集器回收时，会被加入到相关引用队列中。
// 常常用于，管理堆外内存的清理。|DirectByteBuffer|等能够申请堆外内存的对象均与一个虚引用相关联，
// 当|DirectByteBuffer|对象被回收时，会被加入到一个引用队列，此时|GC|会判断队列中的对象，并且
// 对|DirectByteBuffer|对象申请的堆外内存进行清理
